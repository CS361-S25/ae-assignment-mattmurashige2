This artificial ecology consists of two kinds of organisms: Cows and Coyotes. Cows reproduce quickly, as they gain 100 points every process call and take 300 points to reproduce. Coyotes reproduce a lot slower, gaining 100 points per process call and requiring 900 to reproduce. However, Coyotes can gain more points by eating cows. If a Coyote and a Cow are on the same square, the Coyote 'eats' the cow (i.e., is the organism that remains on that square), and gains 200 points.
